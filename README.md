# Udacity Project - 2016 Boston Airbnb

# Description

Airbnb has certainly made an impact on today's hospitality industry. In 2022, Airbnb has recorded 6 million listings in over 100,000 cities world wide, which has left many people wondering, "should I get in on the action?"
Using 2016 Airbnb data from the Boston area, I chose to explore metrics to help investors answer potential questions when comparing property locations. The data consists of 3306 Airbnb listings across 18 neighborhoods.

# Installation and Preperation
  **Libraries**
  
  The libraries used in this project are all native to Anaconda enviroment. The following libraries were used for the project:
```bash
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  from datetime import date as dt
```

  **File**
 
  The file used in this analysis was retrieved from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston.
  The data set consists of 2016 Airbnb listings in the Boston Area. There were a total of 3585 unique obersvations and 95 variables.
  
# Summary of Results
1. I observed that there was no clear relationship between price per nights and utilization rate in the Boston Airbnb listings within the data set 
2. I determined the neighborhoods with the highest potential revenue by combining prices per night and utilization rates
3. Finally, we determined the neighborhoods with the quickest returns on investment given their yearly revenue potential and the median house prices per      
       neighborhood

Other metrics should be considered when exploring potential property investments.
